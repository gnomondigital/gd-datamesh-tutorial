# Data Mesh: 

We are going to implement a data mesh architecture to enable decentralized, domain-driven data ownership and access.

## What is a Data Mesh?

A data mesh is a decentralized architectural paradigm that treats data as a product. It emphasizes domain ownership, self-serve data infrastructure, and federated governance. This approach aims to address the limitations of centralized data lakes and warehouses in complex, rapidly evolving organizations.

## Key Features

* **Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership:** Each domain owns and manages its data products, ensuring data quality and relevance.
* **Data as a Product:** Data is treated as a product with defined interfaces, discoverability, and quality standards.
* **Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform:** A platform provides the necessary tools and services for domains to manage their data products.
* **Federated Computational Governance:** A federated governance model ensures interoperability and compliance across domains.
